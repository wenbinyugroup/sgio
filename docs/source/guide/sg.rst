Structure Gene (SG) Data
==========================

One of the main tasks of sgio is to convert data between different formats.
This will allow users to create SGs with arbitrary complexity using their own tools.
To do this properly, the key is to make sure that all necessary data are provided.

In general, SG data can be grouped into two categories:

* Mesh data

  * Nodal coordinates
  * Element connectivities
  * Node sets
  * Element sets
  * Node data
  * Element data

* Others

  * Materials
  * Additional rotations of materials
  * Analysis configuration
