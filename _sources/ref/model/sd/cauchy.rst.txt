Cauchy Continuum Model
======================

.. currentmodule:: sgio.model

.. note::

   The legacy dataclass-based ``CauchyContinuumModel`` has been removed.
   The Pydantic implementation (formerly named ``CauchyContinuumModelNew``)
   now carries the canonical class name. A compatibility alias named
   ``CauchyContinuumModelNew`` remains available during the migration window.
