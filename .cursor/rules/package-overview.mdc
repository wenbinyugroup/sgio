# SGIO overview

This project is built upon the python package `meshio`. The goal is to convert data of different formats for SG (structure gene). An SG object contains the following data:

1. nodal coordinates
2. element connectivity
3. material properties
4. assignments of materials to each element
5. local reference coordinate systems for materials of each element
6. other configurations for analysis

Items 4 and 5 can be treated as element data. Together with items 1 and 2, they will mainly be handled by the `Mesh` object from `meshio`.

The main job of this package is to:
- convert SG data of different formats
